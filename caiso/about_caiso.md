# CAISO

[California Independent System Operator](http://www.caiso.com/Pages/default.aspx)
is the *only* independent grid operator in the western U.S. It manages the flow
of electricity across the high-voltage, long-distance power lines that make up
80 percent of California’s and a small part of Nevada’s grid. Founded in 1998.

## Public Data CAISO provide:

Every five minutes, CAISO forecasts electrical demand and dispatches the
lowest cost generator to meet demand while ensuring enough transmission
capacity for delivery of power. The API Data link is provided in CSV format.
