# CAISO CO<sub>2</sub> Emission
CAISO supports the stateâ€™s clean air policies by integrating clean, zero carbon resources such as wind and solar.
> CO<sub>2</sub> emissions data is an approximation.

United States Environmental Protection Agency - **EPA**
provides a greenhouse gas equivalencies calculator which helps explain what reducing carbon dioxide (CO<sub>2</sub>) emissions by 1 million metric tons means in everyday terms.

CAISO CO<sub>2</sub> Emissions = Imports + Natural Gas + Biogas + Biomass + Geothermal + Coal

CO<sub>2</sub> is produced when a fuel is combusted to turn generator turbines.

###### Example of fuel sources operate *without emissions*.
* Wind
* solar
* batteries
* hydro
* nuclear

Periods of reduced production of solar and wind resources.
typically causes a **rise in emissions**
