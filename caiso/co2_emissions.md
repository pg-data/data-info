# CAISO CO<sub>2</sub> Emission

The California ISO supports the stateâ€™s clean air policies by integrating clean, zero carbon resources such as wind and solar. This page shows the success in reducing power plant emissions. CO2 emissions data is an approximation. View how CO2 is calculated.


CO2 is produced when a fuel is combusted to turn generator turbines. Wind, solar, batteries, hydro and nuclear operate without emissions.


Emissions typically rise when traditional resources are needed, such as during periods of reduced production of solar and wind resources.
