# CAISO CO<sub>2</sub> Emission
CAISO supports the stateâ€™s clean air policies by integrating clean, zero carbon resources such as wind and solar.
> CO<sub>2</sub> emissions data is an approximation.

United States Environmental Protection Agency - **EPA**
provides a greenhouse gas equivalencies calculator which helps explain what reducing carbon dioxide (CO2) emissions by 1 million metric tons means in everyday terms?

that can help understand what reducing carbon dioxide CO<sub>2</sub> emissions by 1 million metric tons means in everyday terms, translating abstract measurements into concrete terms you can understand, such as the annual emissions from cars, households, or power plants.


CO2 is produced when a fuel is combusted to turn generator turbines. Wind, solar, batteries, hydro and nuclear operate without emissions.


Emissions typically rise when traditional resources are needed, such as during periods of reduced production of solar and wind resources.
