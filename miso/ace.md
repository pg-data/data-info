# Area Control Error

###  Terms:

The instantaneous difference between a Balancing Authority's net actual and scheduled interchange within a control area

Interchange:
Energy transfers that cross Balancing Authority boundaries


The formula for calculation of ACE follows:
ACE = (NIA - NIS) - 10b (FA - FS) Tob + IME
NIA represents actual net interchange (MWs)
NIS represents scheduled net interchange (MWs)
b represents the control area's frequency bias setting (MW/0.1 Hz)
FA represents actual system frequency (Hz)
FS represents scheduled system frequency (60.0 Hz in America)
Tob represents scheduled interchange energy used to bilaterally correct inadvertent accumulations (MWs)
IME represents a manually entered amount to compensate for known equipment error (MWs)
